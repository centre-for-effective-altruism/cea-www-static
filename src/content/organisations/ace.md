Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is dedicated to finding and advocating for highly effective opportunities for improving the lives of animals.

Using research, evidence, and reason, ACE aids compassionate givers, professionals, and volunteers in determining the most effective ways to help animals. 

ACE was founded by 80,000 Hours staff working in Oxford, and until late 2013 was called Effective Animal Activism. Today it is based in California and is financially independent from the Centre, though it remains affiliated.
