The Global Priorities Project is a think tank which develops policy solutions to pressing global challenges which are mistakenly neglected. 

At the moment, we have programmes of work addressing effective public decision-making, global catastrophic risk, and global public health. We are a collaboration with the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford.
