Giving What We Can is an international society dedicated to eliminating extreme poverty. Its members take a pledge committing to donate at least 10% of their incomes to relieve the suffering caused by extreme poverty. 

It is also critical that they donate to the most effective charities, so that it will have the greatest impact possible. To that end, Giving What We Can also undertakes research into the most effective ways to help people in the developing world. It turns out that the difference between charities is astounding: some do 1,000 times as much good with their donation as others!
