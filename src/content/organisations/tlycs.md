The Life You Can Save is a movement of people fighting extreme poverty. It holds that an ethical life involves using some of one's wealth and resources to save and improve the lives of the less fortunate. 

For this reason, it spreads knowledge of what all of us can do to reduce poverty and we encourage people to publicly pledge a percentage of their income to highly effective aid organizations.
