As Director of Communications you will be raising the profile of evidence-based giving and creating thousands of prospective members for our Director of Community to follow up with.

Specifically, you would be responsible for:

* Our mass media and social media presence

* Organising appealing, professional events to attract interest in cost-effective giving.
* Working closely with the Executive Director to shape the communications strategy and branding of the organisation.

We’re a small team, so you’ll also have the opportunity to be involved in recruitment, fundraising, publishing our findings in the media and whatever else most interests you.

###Why work at Giving What We Can

* _Be at the heart of an inspiring community of people who care about others and really put their passion into practice:_ We have members all around the world, all of whom are dedicating a large part of their income to helping people in the developing world as much as they can, and supporting each other in doing so. You would be getting to know these members, answering their questions, providing support to them and helping them to help others.
* _Work with friendly and intellectual staff:_ You’d be working alongside a talented, interesting and highly motivated team.
* _Meet interesting and varied people:_ Giving What We Can shares an office with the rest of the Centre for Effective Altruism and with the Future of Humanity Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. There are always fascinating people around, and we often hold joint seminars and training sessions, as well as many social events.
* _Be part of a fast-growing organisation and social movement:_ It’s a hugely exciting place to be, and has opportunities for swiftly increasing responsibility
* _Help the world:_ Each new member of Giving What We Can saves around 10 lives, meaning that the right person in this job could help prevent over 100 unnecessary deaths each year!
