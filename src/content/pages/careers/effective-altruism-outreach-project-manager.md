Effective Altruism Outreach is the name for an umbrella name for the team inside CEA that works on several EA infrastructure building projects. As a project manager for Effective Altruism Outreach (EAO) you will report to the Executive Director of EAO and work closely with other members of the EAO team to ensure the success of EAOs portfolio of EA movement building projects. Projects may include aspects of[Effective Altruism Global 2016](http://www.eaglobal.org/), aspects of the conference on mitigating existential risk, [Effective Altruism Ventures](http://www.eaventures.org/), [effectivealtruism.org](http://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and future projects developed by the EAO team. You will be primarily responsible for setting timelines and ensuring that the projects are successfully executed. Which projects you manage will be determined by evaluating your interested, experience and skills combined with the needs of the EAO team.

  
The EAO team is growing fast and we believe that this role will be critical to the long-term success of EAO and of the EA movement more generally.

  
## Your main responsibilities will include:

* Creating a project plan for each project and ensuring that key components of the project are completed in a timely manner.

* Leading and managing the budgeting process for each project.

* Recruiting and managing a team of volunteers and EAO staff to ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner.

* Generally ensuring that the projects you manage and well-executed and completed in a timely manner.

* Helping develop movement building strategy and create additional projects that will build the infrastructure of the EA movement.

  
## Why is this role important?

Effective Altruism Outreach is comprised of multiple sub-projects with their own timelines, priorities and needs. This structure allows EAO to pivot into or out of projects as required by the needs of the EA movement. However, it also creates a logistically demanding structure which increases the probability that we fail to execute on projects successfully.

  
The project manager position is essential to ensuring successful execution of EAO projects. The project manager will need to juggle multiple deadlines on multiple projects, coordinate with key stakeholders at CEA, inside the EAO team and in the movement at large and will play a critical role in setting strategy for the projects. The project manage is the person who makes sure that things actually get done.

  
### Qualifications

* Desire to focus on building the EA movement as your primary pathway to improving the world.

* Detailed knowledge of the EA movement and well-reasoned opinions on how the movement can be improved and grown in the future.

* Experience running large, logistically complex projects.

* Long-term commitment to developing skills in logistics and operations.

* Excellent organization skills including a demonstrated ability to juggle multiple projects with competing deadlines and priorities.

* Ability to lead and manage a team including directing volunteers.

* Robust intrinsic motivation. We&rsquo;re looking for someone who can act autonomously with little guidance, who can be tenacious in ensuring that things get done.

  
### Salary and location

Salary is negotiable depending on experience and qualifications. Applicants will work on a project on a paid, trial-hire basis before becoming a full member of the EAO team.

  
Remote work is acceptable as long as the applicant is able and willing to travel to San Francisco, Oxford or other locations on a regular basis.
