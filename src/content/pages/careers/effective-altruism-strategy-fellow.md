The Centre for Effective Altruism is seeking applications from extraordinary people to develop strategy for the effective altruist movement. Start date flexible, from winter 2015.

  
## What does the Centre for Effective Altruism do?

  
We are developing our capabilities for wisely guiding the growing Effective Altruism movement. Founded in 2012, we are a fast-growing start-up non-profit. We have been approximately doubling annually, and currently have about 20 full-time staff. Our aim is to support and develop projects that make the world a better place using evidence and analysis. We are a central part of the effective altruism movement - having developed the term in 2012.

  
The Centre primarily supports effective altruist projects and helps them work together effectively. We would like to increase our capabilities for working out what effective altruism should be aiming to achieve and how it should get there.

  
We are an incredibly exciting place to work - with a strong culture of like-minded and hard-working people, dedicated to doing the most good we can. We&rsquo;re also a great place to grow as fast as you want to - staff are encouraged to take initiative to launch projects and supported in it. People who show promise are rapidly supported to take on responsibility.

  
### Our projects include:

* Giving What We Can: a community of donors giving a tenth of their income to the most effective charities

* 80,000 Hours: a career advice organisation providing career advice for talented young people who want to have a social impact

* Global Priorities Project: a think tank helping decision-makers effectively prioritise ways to do good

* Effective Altruism Outreach: our team developing movement-building infrastructure for effective altruism

  
CEA is based in Oxford, although some of our staff work remotely and in the United States. Although a full-time position based in Oxford is preferred for this role, both part-time and remote work are potentially possible.

  
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

## What will you be working on?

  
You will work directly with the Executive Director of CEA on effective altruist strategy. Questions that might be addressed include:

* What sorts of medium-term outcomes should effective altruism target and why?

* What historical movements, networks, or ideas should EA model itself on?

* How can we frame and structure effective altruist memes in order to influence most effectively? How can we structure the memes for coherence and resilience?

* What level of growth should we target? Which communities should we try to grow through?

  
You will identify a plan of attack on some aspect of the strategic questions facing effective altruism and CEA and will carry out independent research and analysis to suggest approaches to the rest of the team. Some portion of your time will be spent investigating specific topics of research on request that build in directly to work that the Executive Director is doing.

  
## Who would be suited to this job?

  
You should show the ability to clearly consider the strategic implications of different approaches to effective altruism and a deep knowledge of the movement. You should have an opinion of where effective altruism should be going, but should be open to updating that view and to representing the broader strategic aims of the organisation as a whole.

  
### Ideally you would:

* Be self-motivating with a genuine interest in improving the world, and be open-minded about how we can best do that.

* Have some experience in both independent and collaborative research or strategy creation.

* Deeply understand effective altruism and identify with its aims.

* Have good writing skills for academic papers, popular audiences, or both.

* Have strong oral communication skills, one-on-one, in small groups, and in front of audiences.

* Be well organised, helpful, and demonstrate a positive self-improving mindset.
