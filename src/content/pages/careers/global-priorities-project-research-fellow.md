  The Global Priorities Project is seeking applications from exceptional people to expand the research team. Start date flexible, from winter 2015.

  
## What does the Global Priorities Project research?

  
We develop practical tools to better compare the effectiveness of different interventions for improving global welfare in the long-run. These will build on existing prioritisation tools such as cost-effectiveness analysis. The intended audience is government aid agencies, major foundations, policy-advice organisations, effective altruist organisations, and international organisations.

  
We are a collaboration between the Centre for Effective Altruism and the Future of Humanity Institute.

  
### Our research includes three major projects:

* __Cause prioritisation:__ What theoretical judgements shape our views about the best causes to support? What tractable/intractable empirical questions? We are approaching this question from a high level, and [working to resolve key decision points.](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/)

* __Prioritising risk mitigation work under uncertainty:__ When we work to mitigate global catastrophic risks which could come at different times or in different forms, different strategies suit risks that materialise at different points in time. For example, the international community would behave differently if catastrophic climate change were known to be impending on a 20 year horizon than a 100 year horizon. These timelines are characterised by uncertainty. We are [building models to support the allocation of resources](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/allocating-risk-mitigation-across-time/)over projects aiming at different time-horizons, or at scenarios of different levels of plausibility. A major part of this project considers risks from artificial intelligence, and is supported by Elon Musk and the Open Philanthropy Project via a Future of Life Institute grant.

* __How can the international community respond to existential risk?:__ Although the international community is increasingly aware of existential risks, there is still a lack of clear actions to take on a 5-10 year horizon. This project brings together experts to build an action plan for foreign ministries to reduce existential risk. This work builds on the [Unprecedented Technological Risk report](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/unprecedented-technological-risks/) released last autumn. This project is supported by the Finnish Foreign Ministry.

  
Smaller research projects look at global public health, health economics and metrics, evidence-based policy and biosafety.

  
## What is it like to work with us?

Founded in 2012, the Centre for Effective Altruism is a fast-growing start-up non-profit. We have been approximately doubling annually, and currently have about 20 full-time staff. Our aim is to support and develop projects that make the world a better place using evidence and analysis. We are a central part of the effective altruism movement - having developed the term in 2012.

  
We are an incredibly exciting place to work - with a strong culture of like-minded and hard-working people, dedicated to doing the most good we can. We&rsquo;re also a great place to grow as fast as you want to - staff are encouraged to take initiative to launch projects and supported in it. People who show promise are rapidly encouraged to take on responsibility.

  
### Our projects include:

* Giving What We Can: a community of donors giving a tenth of their income to the most effective charities

* 80,000 Hours: a career advice organisation providing career advice for talented young people who want to have a social impact

* Global Priorities Project: a think tank helping decision-makers effectively prioritise ways to do good

* Effective Altruism Outreach: our team developing movement-building infrastructure for effective altruism

  
CEA is based in Oxford, although some of our staff work remotely and in the United States. The roles advertised below require you to be willing to work in Oxford, at least for an initial period.

  
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

## What will you be working on?

  
You will join the research team to work primarily on one of these projects, in addition to smaller projects. Researchers are responsible for delivering high-quality work independently, and contributing to the impact strategy of the project. Communicating work and outcomes to the most relevant communities will form an important part of the work, as will engaging directly with policy-makers.

  
If you work on the prioritisation project you would be expected to have a deep understanding of cause prioritisation, as well as the ability to rapidly become familiar with the key points of specific cause areas.

  
If you work on the risk mitigation project you would be expected to have strong quantitative research skills, as well as the ability to engage in direct empirical work in forecasting and long-term planning, and to survey existing work to estimate current allocation of resources.

  
If you work on the international community project you would be expected to have familiarity with the international institutions and treaties that support existing risk reduction projects.

  
You will be assessed for research fit onto one of these projects, but we value inter-disciplinary experience and ability to learn new fields.

  
Who would be suited to this job?

  
You should be looking for a research position that allows you to direct your work at effective causes, with a strong emphasis on communication and impact. We would like to develop our capabilities in this area, and will therefore be prioritising this skill-set.

  
Ideally you would:

* Be self-motivating with a genuine interest in improving the world, and be open-minded about how we can best do that.

* Have a PhD or other research experience. Experience in both independent and collaborative research would be ideal.

* Knowledge of existing research in economics, cause prioritisation, policy, international institutions, existential risk, modelling, forecasting, philosophy, or of statistics would be useful.

* Have good writing skills for academic papers, popular audiences, or both.

* Have strong oral communication skills, one-on-one, in small groups, and in front of audiences.

* Have a focus on getting impact out of their research.

* Demonstrate the ability to develop a network of contacts in organisations who could use our research.

* Be able to contribute to the research and impact strategy of the Global Priorities Project.

* Because there is the possibility that the role will expand in the future, interest and capability in managing a research team is desireable but not required.
