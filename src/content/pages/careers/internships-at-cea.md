## Details of our Graduate Volunteer Scheme

### About CEA

We are looking for people who want to work for Giving What We Can and the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA).

The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) is a young and rapidly expanding organisation committed to making the world a better place in a considered, evidence-based way. We are affiliated with the University of Oxford, particularly the Future of Humanity Institute, in whose office we are based.

**Giving What We Can** evaluates global poverty charities and encourages people to give 10% of their income to those that are most cost-effective.

By joining CEA, you’ll be part of a focused team of intelligent, enthusiastic and driven colleagues. Everyone involved in CEA is passionate about their work, making the office an inspiring place to be. For more information about what it’s like to work for CEA, see the recruitment pages for [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/about/work-with-us/) and [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/volunteer-or-work-us).

### Working for CEA

All roles are based at our office in Oxford, in a building shared with academics from the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and the Future of Humanity Institute. We welcome applications from overseas, and can provide visas to non-EU applicants.

### Intern with us on our Graduate Volunteer Scheme

We are recruiting for people to volunteer with us full-time in Oxford. We run a Graduate Volunteer Scheme on which people intern with us, generally for at least three months and often for longer. We can often provide accommodation in a house with other volunteers and staff, free lunch, and expenses of up to £10 a day based on financial need, especially for longer-term interns. As you would play an important role for a significant period, we would make sure it didn’t leave you out of pocket.

There are lots of different areas to work on, and there’s plenty of flexibility to adjust the role so it plays to your strengths and development aims. We make it our responsibility to ensure your time here allows you to grow as much as possible, as well as just being lots of fun! The scheme has proved very popular with our current interns, with a stimulating and dedicated atmosphere in the office and a lively and welcoming community outside office hours. Perhaps the strongest evidence of this is that many have extended their stays repeatedly. Once you have applied, we are happy to connect you with a current intern to discuss what it’s like to work here. 

We’re looking for hardworking individuals with a strong desire for personal development who are deeply interested in making the world a better place in an effective way. Your chances of being offered an internship are greatly increased if you can secure your own funding, for example through scholarships and fundraising.

### What we’re looking for

In general, we’re looking for people who have many of the following traits:

- Self-motivated, hard-working, and independent
- Able to deal with pressure and unfamiliar problems
- Have a strong desire for personal development
- Able to quickly master complex, abstract ideas, and solve problems
- Able to communicate clearly and persuasively in writing and in person
- Comfortable working in a team and quick to get on with new people
- Able to lead a team and manage a complex project
- Keen to work with a young team in a startup environment
- Deeply interested in making the world a better place in an effective way, using evidence and research
