  The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) has just gained 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status as a non-profit in the USA. We&rsquo;re after someone to take the lead on our US operations to help us expand and develop our presence in the USA. If you've got a strong focus on optimization and enjoy not only solving complex problems, but finding the best possible solution, let's talk! You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable reading legal documents, financially literate and extremely good at dealing with bureaucracy. As the Director of US Operations, you&rsquo;ll report to the Chief Operating Officer of CEA. We&rsquo;re growing fast, so we&rsquo;re looking for someone who seeks to build a deep understanding of our goals and needs in order to help us build scalable systems and plan for the future

### Your main responsibilities will include:

* Manage all the day-to-day operations related to our US-based projects, staff and donors

* Negotiating a legal agreement that defines the relationship between CEA&rsquo;s UK and US offices

* Finding us an office in the US and getting us all set up

* Setting up processes related to HR and personnel, sorting out everything from employment contracts to payroll, benefits and background checks

* Building an efficient system to make large grants to other EA organisations

* Assisting our US-based donors to donate in a manner which is seamless and tax-efficient.

* Developing multiple payment mechanisms and streamlining our bookkeeping process

* Managing all day-to-day aspects of operating out of the USA including making payments to contractors, drafting letters and documents and creating on-boarding procedures for new staff

* Draw up and pass budgets for CEA USA as a legal entity

* Work with the board of trustees to pass new resolutions and define new charitable objectives as CEA evolves

* Work with a variety of skilled professionals to fulfil all accounting, legal, taxation and compliance requirements related to maintaining 501(c)(3) status in the USA

* Work with EA Ventures projects to organise funding and legal or operational aspects of the projects

* Figure out a process for hiring staff, especially staff from the UK

  
### Why apply?

This role provides an excellent opportunity to get our US operations off the ground. We&rsquo;re looking to double in size over the next year and you will play a key role in shaping the future of the Centre of Effective Altruism. As one of the key team members of a rapidly growing small organisation, you&rsquo;ll have a huge amount of responsibility, autonomy and room to grow. You&rsquo;ll work closely with the directors of each project within the Centre for Effective Altruism, giving you a chance to impact a wide variety of different cause areas and approaches to doing the most good.

If you work for the CEA, you&rsquo;ll be part of a dedicated team of intelligent, caring, enthusiastic colleagues who want to change the world, located in beautiful Oxford.

### Who is suited to this role?

This role will suit someone with high attention to detail, someone with high levels of agency and intrinsic motivation. This job will involve large amounts of autonomy, so you&rsquo;ll need to be someone who can figure out what to do and then go do it with little guidance. We'd love to hear from you if you enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty details of taxation law, banking fees and experimenting with new apps and services to find the best possible services for the whole organisation to use. You are equal parts cautious and bold, you seek to understand all of the rules in great detail to push forward what is possible without undue risk. You are reliable, you work well with deadlines and competing priorities. You can communicate our financial position, employee benefits and donation methods clearly and accurately to different parties and present data that is accurate, clear and actionable.

### Qualifications:

We&rsquo;re seeking someone who has at least 1 year experience working in an operations-heavy role. Suitable experience includes organising events, running and office or holding an administrative role in the US. A university level qualification in business, finance or with some legal background would also be advantageous. Having said this, some of our est operations staff have previously come from backgrounds such as the fast food industry, manufacturing or healthcare.

### Some examples of desirable attributes or experience include:

* Diligence and conscientiousness - Our office culture reflects that of a focused startup, we work hard with intense focus and also relax and unwind together during lunch and after work. You are self-directed enough to work hard alongside the rest of us and engaged and friendly enough to help build our intellectually-stimulating, fun atmosphere. We&rsquo;re all really passionate about the work that we do here and we&rsquo;d like to find someone who feels the same.

* Top-notch verbal and written communication - You&rsquo;ll be working with a distributed team, keeping everyone up to date, achieving consensus and developing rapport when you&rsquo;re geographically isolated is tough, you&rsquo;ll need excellent communication skills to succeed in this role

* Excellent attention to detail - We want someone who carefully evaluates all relevant considerations and then takes action. You&rsquo;ll be solely responsible for the success of our US based operations, the systems you set up will make or break projects in the USA.

* Robust intrinsic motivation - You can act autonomously with little external guidance once you become familiar with a task, you're someone who we can trust to get things done quickly and efficiently without needing to be asked twice.

* Excellent organisational skills - This job requires someone who is really good at juggling multiple priorities and deadlines. The most urgent tasks will not always necessarily be the most important things to work on and striking the right balance can be difficult. 

* Computer skills and a willingness to try new products and services - We need someone who loves trying out different tools before settling on the best one. In this day and age there is an app for every problem, we want you to find out which ones are worth paying for and quickly learn and deploy new systems. We rely heavily on Google Apps and the Google suite of products, you&rsquo;ll need a deep familiarity with Google Sheets and Excel. Understanding of common accounting software such as Xero or QuickBooks is also desirable.
