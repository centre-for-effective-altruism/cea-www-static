## Where does my donation go?

Donations to the Centre for Effective Altruism are split among our existing and new projects depending on where they will do the most good.

You can also restrict your donation to a specific project if you prefer. For more information on why supporting Giving What We Can, 80,000 Hours, or the Global Priorities Project may be the right decision for you, please see the Donate pages of [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/donate), [80,000 Hours](http://80000hours.org/donate), and the [Global Priorities Project](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/donate/).

Animal Charity Evaluators and The Life You Can Save coordinate their finances and donations independently:

*   [Donate to Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/support-our-work/)
*   [Donate to The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Donate)

However, if you are making a major donation to these projects from the UK, we can offer GiftAid and pass the amount on as a grant.
