<h3><i class="fa fa-eur"></i> Transnational Giving Europe</h3>

If you pay tax in Europe, our partners at [Transnational Giving Europe](http://www.transnationalgiving.eu/tge/details.aspx?id=219942&LangType=1033/) can organise tax deductible donations from anywhere in the EU. You can make a donation to any of the partners listed on the TGE website and they'll pass the donation on to us. For help, please email us at **development [at] centreforeffectivealtruism [dot] org** and we will chase up [your country’s details](http://www.transnationalgiving.eu/tge/details.aspx?id=219942&LangType=1033) for you.

<h3><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Not a European Taxpayer?</h3>

If you don't pay tax in Europe, or you don't need your donation to be tax-deductible, please use any of the methods listed on [our page for UK / worldwide donors](/donate/donate-from-the-united-kingdom-worldwide/)</a>.
