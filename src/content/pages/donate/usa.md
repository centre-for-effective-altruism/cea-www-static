We are now a registered, tax-exempt non-profit with 501(c)(3) status in the USA! This means we can accept tax-deductible donations from the USA for both our US and non US-based projects.

<h3><i class="fa fa-money"></i> Bank Transfer</h3>

Please [email us](/contact) and we’ll send you our banking details. Donating via wire transfer saves us a 5% fee from Tides, so this is our preferred method for larger donations. If you indicate that you are a US taxpayer, we will issue an IRS-compliant receipt and send you a copy of our IRS determination letter upon request.

<h3><i class="fa fa-usd"></i> Venmo</h3>

You may now donate to us fee-free using [Venmo](https://venmo.com/). Just search for **@Centrefor-EffectiveAltruism** and tell us which project you would like your donation to go to in the comment section.

<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i> Check</h3>

_Checks are processed by our fiscal sponsor, the [Tides Foundation](http://www.tides.org/). If possible, please consider making a bank transfer instead, which saves us a 5% processing fee._

Please write ‘Centre for Effective Altruism’ on the ‘Memo’ line, make the check payable to ‘Tides Foundation’, then mail to:

**Tides Foundation**
The Presidio
P.O. Box 29903, San Francisco
