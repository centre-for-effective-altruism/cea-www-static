  Event Manager for Effective Altruism Outreach

  
Effective Altruism Outreach is the name for an umbrella name for the team inside CEA that works on several EA infrastructure building projects and events. As an event manager for Effective Altruism Outreach (EAO) you will report to the Executive Director of EAO and will work closely with the EAO team to oversee EAOs portfolio of conferences and events. You will provide vital advice and assistance to several planned projects including, but not limited to, Effective Altruism Global 2016, EA Global X, the EA Strategy Retreat, and the conference on mitigating existential risk. You will be responsible for doing initial logistical planning for the events, recruiting and managing a team of volunteers and EAO staff members, preparing budgets and financial forecasts and ensuring the success of events on the day.

  
The EAO team is growing fast and we believe that this role will be critical to the long-term success of EAO and of the EA movement more generally.

  
Your main responsibilities will include:

* Creating a project plan for each conference listing key components of each event and a clear timeline for completion.

* Leading and coordinating the budgeting process for each event.

* Performing initial logistical tasks including setting a date for the events, booking a venue and booking headline speakers.

* Serving as a logistical point-of-contact during the event and in the days and weeks leading up to the event.

* Recruiting and managing a team of volunteers and EAO staff to ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner.

* Designing event registration and feedback system.

* Generally ensuring that the events go well and that nothing is forgotten or overlooked.

  
Why is this role important?

Conferences and events serve as a centerpiece in EAOs strategy to build the infrastructure of the EA movement. Conferences allow the movement to a) distribute new ideas quickly and effectively; b) provide the ability to create a shared narrative for the community; c) serve as a training and recruiting ground for new EAs and; d) generally improve coordination in the EA community.

  
Our first project in this domain, Effective Altruism Global was the largest gathering of effective altruists in the history of the EA movement. It included over 800 effective altruists across three countries. The San Francisco event featured Elon Musk and was held at the Googleplex, and the Oxford event featured Dan Ariely.

  
It seems plausible that EA Global will set the tone for the EA movement over the coming year and that our execution of the event will create positive (or negative) reverberations throughout the future of effective altruism. Ensuring that future events are carefully strategized and generally well run may be a uniquely compelling opportunity to have an impact for those with relevant skills.

  
Qualifications

* Desire to focus on building the EA movement as your primary pathway to improving the world.

* Long-term commitment to developing skills in logistics and operations.

* Detailed knowledge of the EA movement and well-reasoned opinions on how the movement can be improved and grown in the future.

* Experience running large, logistically complex events.

* Excellent organization skills including a demonstrated ability to juggle multiple projects with competing deadlines and priorities.

* Ability to lead and manage a team including directing and supervising volunteers.

* Robust intrinsic motivation. We&rsquo;re looking for someone who can act autonomously with little guidance, who can be tenacious in ensuring that things get done.

  
Salary and location

Salary is negotiable depending on experience and qualifications. Applicants will work on an event on a paid, trial-hire basis before becoming a full member of the EAO team.

  
Remote work is acceptable as long as the applicant is able and willing to travel to San Francisco, Oxford or other locations as required to attend and prepare for events in these locations.
