As Director of Growth you will be ensuring that interest in effective giving actually translates to more donations to effective charities, and thereby more people helped. You will report to the Executive Director, Michelle Hutchinson.

### Specifically, you'll be responsible for:

- Building relationships with people interested in donating effectively to offer assistance

- Chatting to people one on one about questions and concerns they might have about joining Giving What We Can, doing Try Giving, or donating to top charities.

- Following up on requests for more information, tracking potential members who planned to get more involved later on, and ensuring that we have a reliable system for regular contact.

- Our social media presence

We&rsquo;re a small team, so you&rsquo;ll also have the opportunity to be involved in recruitment, fundraising, publishing our findings in the media and whatever else most interests you.

## Why work at Giving What We Can

* Be at the heart of an inspiring community of people who care about others and really put their passion into practice:

  We have members all around the world, all of whom are dedicating a large part of their income to helping others as much as they can, and supporting each other in doing so. You would be getting to know these members, answering their questions, providing support to them and helping them to help others.

* Work with friendly and intellectual staff:

  You&rsquo;d be working alongside a talented, interesting and highly motivated team.

* Meet interesting and varied people:

  Giving What We Can shares an office with the rest of the Centre for Effective Altruism and with the Future of Humanity Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. There are always fascinating people around, and we often hold joint seminars and training sessions, as well as many social events.

* Be part of a fast-growing organisation and social movement:

  It&rsquo;s a hugely exciting place to be, and has opportunities for swiftly increasing responsibility

* Help the world!

  Each new member of Giving What We Can saves around 10 lives, meaning that the right person in this job could help prevent over 100 unnecessary deaths each year!

## Why apply?

This role has great potential for impact: Over the past couple of years, Giving What We Can has reached millions of people with its message of committing to donate the most effective charities. It&rsquo;s crucial to ensure that people have all the information they need to act on that message. By leading our individual outreach, you can help move thousands of pounds to effective charity. You will achieve this by interacting daily with people who are passionate about helping others. As one of the key team members of a rapidly growing small organisation, you&rsquo;ll have great responsibility, autonomy and room to grow.

If you work for Giving What We Can, you&rsquo;ll be part of a focused team of intelligent, caring, enthusiastic colleagues who want to change the world, located in beautiful Oxford.

## Who would it suit?

We&rsquo;re looking for someone who cares deeply about alleviating extreme poverty as effectively as possible and is excited to get others on board with that aim.

You&rsquo;ll need excellent written and spoken communications skills, to enjoy interacting with large numbers of people, be very conscientious and thrive within a team.

Some examples of experience that would be especially useful include journalism and sales – though we&rsquo;re interested in anyone who can demonstrate the skills. Also helpful would be experience with customer relationship management systems such as CiviCRM or Salesforce.

Your application will be assessed using a rubric designed to measure the following traits, and you should aim to demonstrate them in your application:
