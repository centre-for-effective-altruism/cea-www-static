Effective Altruism Outreach

2016 plan

# Overview

The goal of Effective Altruism Outreach is to enable to EA community to reach its full potential. We do this by creating the infrastructure the EA community needs to be a robust, thriving social movement while ensuring that we stay true to the values that make this community exciting.

This represents a bit of a departure from the 2015 project plan where we defined the goals of the project as “to grow and strengthen the EA movement.” To accomplish this goal, we marketed two books on effective altruism: “The Most Good You Can Do” by Peter Singer and “Doing Good Better” by Will MacAskill. We created effectivealtruism.org as a landing page for EA and quickly caused it to become the number one search result under effective altruism. We created Effective Altruism Ventures and began helping to fund new EA projects. Finally, we ran Effective Altruism Global across three continents in a single month and began launching EA Global X, a yearly conference series on effective altruism that will take place all over the world.

Over 2015 we also saw rapid growth in the EA community. Giving What We Can grew from 670 members to 1,333\. GiveWell saw nearly 100% growth in total donors (Note 1). EA Global quintupled in size from around 200 attendees last year to nearly a thousand this year. In addition, more effort has been going towards growing the EA community. Projects like LEAN and Jon Courtney’s work on chapter seeding at Giving What We Can developed over the last year as did a significant rise in the number of volunteer local organizers in cities all around the world.

Our plan for 2016 is to pivot from focusing growing the EA community and towards focusing on enabling the EA community to reach its full potential. It seems to us that EA is at a point in its development where it is likely to continue to grow rapidly without marginal effort from our team. Yet, comparatively little marginal effort seems to be allocated to ensuring that the EA community has the infrastructure in place to ensure that EA grows in helpful rather than harmful ways. EAO will work on developing this infrastructure.

The reference class of social movements is not a kind one to effective altruism. Most social movements fail. Still more social movements accomplish something short of their goals. Yet, effective altruism runs all of the risks inherent in social movements combined with the risks inherent in pursuing ambitious goals like ending poverty or stopping factory farming. We should expect the mainline result for EA to be a fraction of the impact we can achieve if EA does exceptionally well. And, we should expect the most probable outcome to be the eventual collapse of effective altruism. Avoiding this result will require that we intentionally build infrastructure, cooperation mechanisms and facilitate healthy social environments to help EA avoid potential existential risks to the movement and to ensure that we grow and flourish as a community.

# Projects for 2016

The EAO team works on a collection of projects that we think will best enable EA to reach its full potential. These projects fall under three groups: events, community and coordination. Below we explain the rationale behind the category and discuss which projects we plan to work on.  

Ultimately, however, the EAO team plans to be flexible in its approach to project selection. Much of what we do is determined by how things are going in the EA community and what we learn about how we can best enable EA to achieve its goals. So, we treat the list below as our best guess for our activities during the year while retaining some probability that our ultimate activities are somewhat different from these.

## **Events**

Events like conferences and other in-person meetings provide a productive way to accomplish all of the components of a flourishing EA community. Conferences allow the community to share insights, strategies and plans in an environment that makes it maximally easy to update, thus dramatically improving information exchange. Conferences improve resource allocation by allowing potential hires and funders to talk to major EA projects in a low-stakes environment. Finally, conferences provide a great introduction to EA for newcomers allowing them to be easily onboarding and connected to the community.  

### Effective Altruism Global 2016

A major project for the year will be running EA Global again in 2016\. To accommodate the increasing interest in EA, EA Global in 2016 will need to be even bigger and even better. We are still in the initial planning stage for this project and will provide more details as they become available.

### Effective Altruism Global X

Effective Altruism Global X is like TEDx to EA Global’s TED. The goal of EAGx is to help local movement builders run EA conferences all over the world throughout the year. The EA Global team will provide initial funding, marketing support, speaker support, the EA Global X brand, and guidance to local movement builders who want to run their own conferences but the events will be run by members of the local community. The first EAGx happened in Basel, Switzerland September 4-6\. We’re in talks with nearly 20 local organizers who want to run EAGx events in cities like Berlin, London, New York, Boston, Melbourne and more.

### Academic conferences on Effective Altruism

A more speculative area that the EAO team might explore is running academic conferences focused on EA ideas. The Effective Altruism community has already been able to attract an impressive collection of academics including Steven Pinker, Steven Levitt, Dan Ariely, Joshua Greene, Peter Singer, Nick Bostrom, and Larry Summers among others. However, the number of academics working on developing and improving EA ideas is quite small. In order to develop a robust intellectual community, it may make sense to use our strong existing networks in various academic communities to catalyze additional intellectual development.

## **Community**

If Effective Altruism is going to be a social movement, it has to be _social_. If the EA community comes up with groundbreaking ways to improve the world, but is a toxic and uninviting community, we will still fail to accomplish our goals. Similarly, if EAs can’t find other people with whom to collaborate, our maximum impact may be much lower than it would be otherwise.

### Effective Altruism: Build

After thinking about movement-building a lot, it seems to us that much of the EA community has to be local. One of the important components of the current EA community is that effective altruism becomes a part of people’s identity. It seems plausible that while people respond to the arguments we make, they respond more to gaining the social support that a local community of EAs can provide. We plan to build out this local infrastructure as one component of a flourishing EA community.

Effective Altruism: Build is a joint project between EAO and Giving What We Can with the goal of building this local infrastructure. The project will focus on creating new local groups in cities and in universities around the world. It will also focus on providing more resources and help to groups that are already successful. Our hope is to be the central hub for local EA community building.

### Community management

One way that effective altruism might fail is that we fail to create a community that people actually want to be involved in. Therefore, it’s important to ensure that the community is functioning well and to address any issues in the community as they arise. Towards this goal, the EAO team has hired Julia Wise to monitor the development of the EA community and to help steer the community in more helpful directions in the future.

### Effective Altruism Ventures

Earlier this year we launched [Effective Altruism Ventures](http://www.eaventures.org/) to help connect the EA entrepreneur community with the EA funding community. This project has shown promise, receiving over 80 applications in our first three months and building a large, aligned funder network. We plan to devote additional person-hours to the project to improve our evaluation abilities and to ensure that we evaluate projects more swiftly than we do currently.

## **Coordination**

One strength of the effective altruism community is that the shared identity and values promotes useful coordination. EA organizations frequently share or direct resources (e.g. talent, money) to one another and the shared set of ideas and values that EA promotes makes it relatively easy for people to collaborate on projects. However, the current situation is far from perfect. We plan to work on a number of projects that will improve coordination by providing useful information that can help people in the community collaborate.

### Analytics

Despite being a purportedly data-driven community, we have surprisingly little data on how the EA community is functioning. We don’t have a clear sense of how many EAs there are, of how fast the EA community is growing, of whether our messages about EA resonate with our audience and so on. One of the first projects we plan to work on in information exchange is setting up the basic analytics infrastructure necessary to begin collecting this information.

### Effectivealtruism.org

We created effectivealtruism.org earlier this year as the landing page for EA and the site is currently the number one hit under the search term “effective altruism.” There is much more that can be done to improve how we present EA and to improve the technology behind the site. We currently have an automated infrastructure to connect new EAs with local movement builders, job opportunities and more as soon as they join the movement although this could be improved. We also plan to improve the branding of the site to focus on the intellectual content of effective altruism.

### EA Newsletter

The fragmented nature of the EA community makes it difficult to keep up to speed with what’s going on throughout the movement. In collaboration with others at .impact, we created the EA newsletter which goes out to thousands of EAs. We plan to use other projects we create to encourage people to join the EA newsletter and we plan to continue to develop interesting content for the newsletter.

# Budget

EAO can productively use as much as $825,650\. However, different levels of investment in the project would produce different returns and would allow the team to productively execute different projects. In general, we plan to keep the core EAO team together if at all possible. This team is capable of high-level planning and social strategy as well as basic execution. Additional money would allow us to gain higher leverage on the skills and abilities of the core team meaning we can execute more high-impact projects with a greater level of focus on the top-level strategic priorities of the projects.

Below we outline three potential budgets for the EAO team: A growth, moderate, and basic budget. These budgets give a sense of what different levels of investment in the team will allow us to achieve. Note that the total amount needed according to these budgets is $110,000 less than the total. This reflects a donation for the EA Build project that we received earlier this year.

## EAO Growth budget

On this budget we would be sufficiently resourced to accomplish all of our important goals for the year and to expand rapidly to accommodate the growth of the EA community. On this budget we would be able to do the following:


* Effective Altruism Global 2016
  * We would aim for an extremely large, very well-produced event that would potentially involve thousands of people.
  * We would hire at least 5 full time contractors for 3 months leading up to the event and an event manager to oversee things.
  * We could produce multiple side events during EA Global to attract key influencers to care about our issues.
  * Last year we held the State of AI-Safety 2015 event which involved Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Nick Bostrom and Stuart Russell among others. We could run a similar event this year.
  * We could hold closed-door meetings for key HNW individuals to introduce them to EA principles.
  * We could also run a side event focused on incorporating EA ideas into politics.
  * A higher-quality event would significantly improve our chances of attracting high-level speakers like Elon Musk or Dan Ariely again this year. Our stretch target would be to get Bill Gates to attend.


* Academic conference
  * We would be able to hold an academic-focused conference as a side event after EA Global. This would allow us to discuss more cutting-edge ideas during EAG than we were able to discuss this year.
  * We would also develop an academic conferencing targeting specific areas of interest to the EA community (e.g. development economics or practical ethics). We would plan to launch at least one of these during 2016.


* Effective Altruism: Build
  * The Effective Altruism: Build project would have a full time person in Boston working in close contact with the Harvard EAs and working on developing other strong groups at schools like Tufts and MIT
  * We would hire a full time person in San Francisco who would work on organizing the strong existing community.
  * We would hire a full-time person in London which is a vibrant, but under invested-in community.
  * We would also hire a part-time movement builder in Australia to help extend the momentum we created by holding EA Global in Melbourne.
  * The EA: Build team would be able to rapidly test new tactics and iterate to gain insights into how to do movement building effectively.


* EAGx
  * We will devote around 20 hours per week to encouraging new groups to run EAGx events and to helping out with the organizing of EAGx events if the organizing teams are less experienced.
  * We would devote staff time in Boston, Melbourne, and London to ensuring that EAGx events happen there as well.
  * We would expect that we will be able to run around 9-12 EAGx events over the course of the year reaching around 2,000 potential effective altruists.


* Effective Altruism Ventures
  * We will plan to pay someone full time to do EA Ventures evaluations and to help source new projects.
  * This would considerably speed up the timeline for evaluating projects and would increase the diversity of projects that apply.


* Community management
  * Julia Wise would be able to focus primarily on community management.


* Effectivealtruism.org
  * We would hire a part-time contractor to manage effectivealtruism.org and to make it a much more robust and useful site.


* The EA newsletter
  * We would devote staff time to curating a content-rich EA newsletter to keep the EA community up-to-speed on what’s happening in effective altruism.


* Analytics
  * We would be able to set up a high-quality systems of data collection and tracking to track the trajectory of the EA community.

## EAO Moderate budget

On the EAO Moderate budget we would be able to maintain our existing projects and expand into some new high-impact areas. However, we would be unable to run some potentially valuable projects and others would be run at a smaller scale than they would on the growth budget. On this budget we would be able to do the following:

* Effective Altruism Global 2016
  * We would devote somewhat less core staff time to logistical tasks in organizing the event and would instead devote more staff time to event strategy.
  * We would aim for a larger, more well-produced event even if doing so would require significant staff time.
  * We would hire at least 3 full time contractors for 3 months leading up to the event and would hire an event manager to oversee all the conferences run by EAO.
  * The quality of the event would give us some chance of attracting high-level speakers like Elon Musk or Dan Ariely again this year.


* Academic conference
  * We would be able to hold an academic-focused conference as a side event after EA Global.
  * We may also be able to develop an academic conference targeting specific areas of interest to the EA community (e.g. development economics or practical ethics) although the availability of resources may not permit this.


* Effective Altruism: Build
  * The Effective Altruism Build: project will start with a full time person in Boston and a full time person in San Francisco.
  * The core EAO team will spend time testing new tactics and working on high-level strategy with Jesse.


* EAGx
  * We will devote around 10 hours per week to encouraging new groups to run EAGx events, and to assisting the groups in executing a high-quality event.
  * We expect that we will be able to run around 6 of these over the course of the year reaching around 1,000 potential effective altruists.


* Effective Altruism Ventures
  * We will pay someone part-time to do evaluations for EA Ventures. This will considerably speed up the evaluation process and would make EA Ventures more useful to the projects we evaluate.


* Community management
  * Julia Wise would be able to focus primarily on community management and less on Boston-area organizing.

### EAO Basic Budget

The EAO basic budget would allow the EAO team to maintain our current core projects, but would offer little room for expansion into new projects. On the EAO basic budget the team will be able to execute the following projects:

* Effective Altruism Global 2016
  * We will spend a large amount of core staff time organizing EA Global in 2016\.
  * We will aim for a much simpler format (single city, less time spent on program design and speakers) to reduce the time we spend executing the project.
  * If we need to hire outside help we will bake this cost into the ticket price.


* Effective Altruism: Build
  * The Effective Altruism: Build project will begin in two cities: San Francisco and Boston.
  * Boston organizing will be run by Julia and Jesse, with Jesse devoting a considerable amount of time to helping the San Francisco team.
  * San Francisco organizing will be run by Tyler with help from Peter Buckley, Roxanne, and Kerry. The SF team’s time will be split between this project and other projects.


* EAGx
  * We will devote a few hours a week of an EAG staff member’s time to responding to requests for assistance in running an EAGx event.
  * We will generally not seek out people to encourage them to run an event and will provide minimal assistance.

The following projects will continue to exist, but will be put into maintenance mode:

* Effective Altruism Ventures
  * We will continue to work on EA Ventures as time and attention allow. This will involve around 4 rounds of evaluations (one every 3 months) and occasional discussions with funders.


* Effectivealtruism.org
  * The site will mostly stay as-is for the foreseeable future.


* The EA newsletter
  * We would probably be unable to execute this project.


* Analytics
  * We would probably be unable to execute this project.


* Academic conference
  * We would probably be unable to execute this project.

# Team

Given the nature of some of EAOs projects (like conferences), the EAO team is likely to grow and shrink over time. However, we expect to have a core team that works on most of the projects run under EAO. The core team will grow to be a be a bit larger on the moderate or growth budgets. Our current core team is as follows:

# What did we accomplish over 2015?

At the beginning of 2015, the core EA Outreach team was Niel Bowerman, Kerry Vaughan, and Tyler Alterman. With this small starting team, we were able to accomplish the following.

## Effective Altruism Global

We ran Effective Altruism Global which included EA conferences in San Francisco, Melbourne, and Oxford all during the month of August. In total we gathered over 900 EAs together during EA Global, quintupling the number of EAs that attended the EA Summit in 2014.

The full impact of EA Global is difficult to calculate, and many of the connections made at EA Global will bear fruit over time. Our post-event survey received relatively few responses, but showed some encouraging signs that the event was successful. In San Francisco around 25% of survey respondees reported some degree of plan change. In Oxford, of those that responded, 11% reported that they did not consider themselves a member of the EA community before EA Global, but do consider themselves part of the community subsequently. We do not think that either of these measures can be extrapolated to the pool of all attendees, but they provide some sense of the magnitude of the impact that EAG achieved.

Anecdotally, we know of at least $50,000 in donations that would not have occurred without EAG, although this number is likely to increase as many organizations raise money during December. We know of a few hires and potential hires that resulted from EAG. We also know of at least 12 GWWC pledges (worth $804,000 in expected money donated according to Giving What We Can (Note 3)) that are directly tied to EAG attendance. However, the biggest qualitative impact probably comes from the fact that we were able to host the event at the Googleplex and that we were able to influence a number of Googlers to become more interested in the EA community.

## State of AI Safety 2015

At EA Global: San Francisco we also ran an event in collaboration with Niel Bowerman and Daniel Dewey called The State of AI Safety 2015\. Attendees included Elon Musk (SpaceX and Tesla), Gaverick Matheny (Director of IARPA), Howie Lempel (Open Phil), Mustafa Suleyman (DeepMind), Scott Nolan (Founders Fund), Sam Altman (YCombinator), and Stuart Russell (UC Berkeley), among others. 

While details of the conversations at the meeting are confidential, the discussion was extremely productive on a number of fronts. In particular, after the event, DeepMind asked Will MacAskill to announce that they were looking to hire for a number of positions and that they were specifically interested in recruiting EAs.

## Books on Effective Altruism

The EAO team marketed two of the four books on Effective Altruism that came out this year: _The Most Good You Can Do_ by Peter Singer and _Doing Good Better_ by Will MacAskill. Both books were well received although neither was a breakout success. Our initial results from marketing these books are below, although we expect more sales of the books over time.

### The Most Good You Can Do

We successfully helped market Peter Singer’s book _The Most Good You Can Do_. As of early October the book had sold over 13,000 copies and received coverage in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, NPR and more.

### Doing Good Better

We successfully marketed Will MacAskill’s book _Doing Good Better__,_ resulting in around 4,000 books sold as of October. Will received coverage in over 100 media outlets including Time, Forbes, and posts by both Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation. Will also recorded a podcast with Tim Ferriss for The Tim Ferriss Show which is set for release in the near future.

## Effectivealtruism.org

We created [effectivealturism.org](http://effectivealtruism.org/) as the landing page for effective altruism. The site quickly became the number one search result for the term “effective altruism.” The site receives around 7,000 visits a month and has received around 2,000 email signups.

## EA Branding

Through work with Andy Fallshaw and the folks at Bellroy, we executed a rebrand of EA, moving it away from the old logo to the clearer, more professional lightbulb logo used in this document. We used this logo to help established a design aesthetic for EA which was on display at EA Global. We also coined a new mantra for EA: “Figure out how to do the most good, then do it.”

## VIP Outreach

We were able to reach out to a significant number of VIPs to encourage interest in the EA community. Some highlights include:

* Elon Musk
  * Spoke at EA Global, attended the State of AI Safety 2015 and received a copy of Will’s book. It’s currently unlikely that Elon identifies as an effective altruist.


* The Gates Foundation and Bill Gates
  * The Chief Communication Officer of the Gates Foundation spoke at EA Global. Recently, Will has met with a number of the senior management team at the Foundation including the CEO and Director of Philanthropic partnerships.


* Bryan Johnson (multimillionaire founder of Braintree and of [OS Fund](http://osfund.co/))
  * Met with Tyler and other members of the EA community in San Francisco. Subsequently Bryan joined EA Ventures as a funder and was a speaker and attendee at EA Global.


* Sam Altman (leader of [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/))
  * Attended the State of AI Safety meeting and has been interacting with the 80,000 Hours team.


* YCombinator
  * YCombinator signed on as a partner organization on EA Ventures. YC usually does not do partnerships, but they made an exception in our case and are very interested in hearing about new EA startups (especially nonprofits).


* Dan Ariely
  * Spoke at EA Global: Oxford and met with a number of members of the EA community after his talk.


* Tim Urban (Author of [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/))
  * Spoke at EA Global: San Francisco. Has been in communication with Will since then.


* Jacquelline Fuller (leader of [Google.org](http://google.org/))
  * Spoke at EA Global: San Francisco and provided a $10,000 grant for the event.


* Tim Ferriss
  * Recorded a 2+ hour [podcast](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/22/will-macaskill/) on EA with Will MacAskill.


* Foundations
  * Tyler presented on Effective Altruism to a gathering of 18 different major foundations including Rockefeller, the Gates Foundation, Hewlett, and Skoll.
  * We have developed relationships with a number of other foundations including Google.org, and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

## EA Ventures

EA Ventures has attracted 22 funders from both inside the EA community and from other communities. Funders range from foundation and venture capital funders to smaller EA funders and include partner organizations like YCombinator, Full Circle Fund and the OS Fund. To date we have received around 100 applications and has helped moved around $100,000 to effective organizations.

## Effective Altruism Global X

We launched the first Effective Altruism Global X event in Basel, Switzerland the week after EA Global: Oxford. Since then we’ve redesigned the eaglobal.org website to include information on how organizers can set up their own EAGx event and we’ve developed a set of tools and information to assist organizers. We’ve received interest in running an EAGx event from over 20 different organizers although we expect the total number of EAGx events to be much lower.

* * *

# Conclusion

Over the course of 2015, the EAO team has accomplished much more than we thought we would at the start of the year. We built a more capable and dedicated team than seemed achievable and we were able to work on projects at a scale much larger than we imagined.

However, the challenges that we will face in 2016 are likely to be much greater than the challenges we faced this year. The EA community is likely to continue to grow rapidly, and more work will be needed to ensure that this growth is positive for the long-term future of effective altruism. Over the course of 2016, we should expect to attract skilled opposition from traditional philanthropy as the strength and influence of our ideas increases. We should expect consistent pressure to spread EA as widely as possible even if doing so compromises some of the key values of the community. We should expect that as EA grows and develops, it will be increasingly more difficult to help guide the community if we get off track.

But, these are challenges worth facing. In _Doing Good Better,_ Will makes the point that we may be living in a very unique time where relatively ordinary people can make a tremendous difference. Hundreds of years ago there was plenty of suffering in the world, but those fortunate enough to be born well-off couldn’t do much to improve the situation. Getting accurate information about what was happening was difficult and getting resources to those in need was nearly impossible. It is only now that we have both widespread suffering and the information and resources to alleviate some of that suffering. This represents a tremendous opportunity for those who want to make the world better.

The effective altruism community has the basic tools we need to seize the opportunity available to us. Together, we might be able to accomplish incredible things like stopping factory farming, ending global poverty, reducing existential risk or discovering new ways to make a difference in the world. Together we have the ability to make the world much better than we found it.

But, getting there won’t be easy. The next few years are likely to be pivotal for the EA community. The next few years will determine whether EA becomes a passing fad like the Ice Bucket Challenge or Kony 2012, or whether EA becomes a global force for good. To achieve the full potential of this community we will need to be strategic about how the community develops and about how we spread our ideas. To achieve the full potential of this community we will need to be vigilant to ensure that effective altruism stays effective. The hope of the EAO team is that we can play a part in helping the EA community thrive. Our hope is that the tremendous amount that this community has accomplished so far is only the beginning.
