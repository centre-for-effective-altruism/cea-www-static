### [Global Priorities Project](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/)

Every day, policymakers, foundations, and individuals are making tough trade-offs. Prioritising is never easy - and it is hardest when we’re making big, evidence-based decisions about how to make the world better off. The Global Priorities Project exists to make these trade-offs easier to evaluate robustly. We are a collaboration between the Centre for Effective Altruism and the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford.

This year, we made significant progress and produced tangible results:

*   The Department for International Development reallocated £2.5bn to fund research into treating and responding to the diseases that cause the most suffering rather than direct work. We had [recommended this](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/12/new-uk-aid-strategy-prioritising-research-and-crisis-response/) [to policy-makers](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/12/new-uk-aid-strategy-prioritising-research-and-crisis-response/) based on our primary and secondary research, and were one of several who made similar recommendations.[^1]
*   We built existential risk policy and strategy recommendations that we shared at the State of AI Safety 2015 and received a grant from the Future of Life Institute to extend this work, and one from the Finnish government to lay the foundations for an international coalition on existential risk coordination,

*   The UK government is changing the way they evaluate risks in the National Risk Assessment framework partly in response to our advice on accounting for [type of risk](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Risk-Register.pdf) and distinguishing [preparation from assessment](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Impact-and-response-assessments.pdf).

We believe that policy is an important and neglected area for effective altruists. Our connections with policy-makers and our solid research foundations give us good reasons to expect work here to be tractable, as do our short term successes and pipeline of opportunities. Our research work is fully supported by grants, but we aim to raise a further £133,000 this winter to let us take advantage of the stream of high-value policy opportunities that our research creates. To do this we will expand our team to incorporate experience in civil service and evidence-based policy-making. Donations towards our minimum target of £70,000 will be matched until we reach that target. You can find further details and links to other resources below.

### Policy is an important but neglected area for direct effective altruist work

Engaging with governments should be very important to effective altruists. Governments allocate roughly 45% of the OECD’s GDP.[^2] The UK and USA together spend more than $50bn a year on overseas aid, around three orders of magnitude greater than effective altruist donations.[^3] Moreover, government resource allocation is often highly centralised. This means that changing just a few minds can have enormous direct impact. Despite this, very few effective altruists are actively addressing policy topics. This also increases the learning value for the effective altruist community from projects like ours.

### Policy within the UK appears to be tractable

There are early indicators that policy is tractable for us. We have strong relationships with key individuals in the UK and abroad based on the high quality of our research and our focus on impartial evaluation of the evidence. This gives us a stream of opportunities to meet policy-makers to offer methodological advice on the best ways to allocate huge flows of resources. Our research has fed into government publications.[^fn-4] The UK especially is highly responsive to expert input in policy decisions, especially in areas seen as technical rather than politically driven.

### The first £35,000 of donations to us this winter will be matched

This winter, we are aiming to reach a minimum of £217,000 to cover our costs for 2016 and ideally to raise £280,000 to provide us with some security into 2017\. We have already secured £147,000 for next year. This means we have two targets:

*   Basic - £70,000 more (fully matched) - covers our costs for the year allowing us to expand cautiously. One of our supporters will match every donation made until we reach this basic target.
*   Goal - £133,000 more - covers our costs for the year, lets us invest in new opportunities as they emerge, lets us avoid the resource intensive process of fundraising until next winter

If you are interested in donating you can do so [here](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/donate/donate-from-the-united-kingdom-worldwide), or [email me](mailto:seb@prioritisation.org) for more details.
