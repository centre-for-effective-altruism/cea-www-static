### [Global Priorities Project](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/)

The Global Priorities Project [engages](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/10/update/) with policy-makers and develops original research on cause prioritisation and effective altruist strategy. Even though governments allocate roughly 45% of the developed world’s resources, they remain neglected by effective altruists. We exist to change that.

Within policy, our proposals have been adopted by the UK government on [catastrophic](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Risk-Register.pdf) [risk](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Impact-and-response-assessments.pdf) and [development](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/12/new-uk-aid-strategy-prioritising-research-and-crisis-response/) and we have held multiple high level meetings on a broader range of topics including [existential risk](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/unprecedented-technological-risks/), development strategy, animal welfare, and evidence-based policy. In addition, we are consulting for the Finnish government on existential risk reduction policy.

Within research, our model for movement building is widely cited and our work on how to estimate the [value of research](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/project-overview-problems-of-unknown-difficulty/) and [future-oriented work](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/allocating-risk-mitigation-across-time/) has led to concrete policy recommendations as well as grants for work on [existential risk strategy](http://futureoflife.org/data/full-proposal-files/Global_Priorities_Project_-_3.pdf). We are also experimenting with work to increase the [supply of AI safety researchers](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/10/three-areas-of-research-on-the-superintelligence-control-problem/).
