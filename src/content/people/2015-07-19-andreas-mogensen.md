Andreas is an Examination Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He studied philosophy at Cambridge (B.A.) and Oxford (B.Phil, D.Phil) and was a visiting scholar at Duke University. His current research focuses on the extent to which moral philosophers can be considered ethical experts and the issue of how to weigh harms and benefits of different magnitudes in the context of risk.
