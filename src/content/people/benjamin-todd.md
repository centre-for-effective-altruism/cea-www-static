Ben co-founded 80,000 Hours in 2011 while graduating with a 1st in his Masters in Physics and Philosophy at Oxford. Outside of 80,000 Hours, he was the first and only undergraduate to intern as an analyst at a top investment fund. Rather than taking the job, he persuaded the Chairman to donate Â£60,000 to 80,000 Hours.
