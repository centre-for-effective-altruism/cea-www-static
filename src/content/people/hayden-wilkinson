Hailing from rural Australia, Hayden is currently spending a gap year working as a research intern for Giving What We Can. He holds Bachelor degrees in both mathematics and philosophy, having graduated first in his year with a university medal and first class honours, and is commencing an MPhil in philosophy at Cambridge later this year. He has previously done research into infinite ethics and the metaphysics of causation but, while at Giving What We Can, concentrates on finding and evaluating the most cost-effective charitable interventions.
