Larissa is a Communications Manager at Giving What We Can. She previously managed our social media and a local chapter on a voluntary basis. Larissa studied Politics and Sociology, volunteered as a campaign coordinator and stood in local elections. Since then she has spent five years in corporate sales, events and marketing. In her spare time she enjoys running and playing football (badly).
