Peter studied Philosophy at the University of Sussex, graduating with a 1st and two awards for academic achievement. He was offered a Philosophical Quarterly bursary to study the M.Litt at St Andrews, but decided to postpone his return to academia in order to increase his social impact potential. Before joining 80,000 Hours, Peter accumulated over 5 years' experience as a web developer with clients including UK charities Electrical Safety First, and the Child Safety Trust. He is also cofounder of a co-working space in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.
